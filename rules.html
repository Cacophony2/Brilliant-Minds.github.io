      <h4>Probation Punishments</h4>
      <p>
        For anything excessively profane, if you got banned for it in TPT, you <b>will</b> be demoted and placed on level 3 probation for 4 weeks, then you will be moved to level 1 probation.<br>
        <b>If you get 5 punishments like this, you will be banned from the group.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        For any other few-days ban, the Fleet Admiral will ask you for the reason and then ask jacob1 about it. If the reasons don't match, you will be demoted once.<br>
        For any unnescessary ban, a trial and a hearing will be convened. This will determine what punishment is given, if any.
      </p>
      <h5>Probation Levels</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Level 1: Light restrictions from group activities, it will <b>not</b> affect your promotion. May go on your record and lasts for one week.</li>
        <li>Level 2: Medium restrictions from group activities. <b>May</b> affect your promotion during the next Inactive Movement Cycle, and this may go on your record.<br>
        If you receive this and then receive a level 3 probation, you will be <b>discharged</b>. Lasts for 3 weeks.</li>
        <li>Level 3: Whatever you did to deserve this, it was bad. Heavy restrictions from group activities, no promotion in the next two IMCs, and if you get another level 2 or higher probation, you will be <b>discharged</b>.<br>
        Also, any Admirals Counsel members who are a group manager and get this probation will be changed down to a Member for 2 months. Will go on you record. Lasts for 3 months.</li>
        <li>Level 4 (<i>waiting list</i>): This essentially means that we are deciding who you are being replaced with. Goodbye.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Trials</h4>
      For any severe (or at least partially) offense made by an Admiral, a trial will be convened. There shall be a prosecutor, defense attourney, jury of peers (people of the same counsel), testimonials and a judge (the current Fleet Admiral). All people participating in this trial will have their ranks suspended for reasons against biased judgement, except the judge.<br>
      Any actual offense made by an Admiral is more serious than that of any other member, obviously. But if an Admiral is being prosecuted, <b>no one below the AC sit-in Commander may post to the thread.</b> Breaking this rule is punishable by <b>discharge.</b>
