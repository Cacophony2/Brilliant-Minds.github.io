      <h4>Goals</h4>
      I wish to make it the goal of all of BMN to be the greatest at what we do. My goal is to have <b>at least</b> two BMN member-made saves on the first page at the same time, and that whenever someone searches the words Ship, Sea, Weapon or Bomb, they see BMN member-made saves <b>first</b>.

      <h4>BMN Save Logo</h4>
      This is the logo for BMN. It would benefit us a <b>lot</b> if you could put one of these logos into your saves.<br>

      <h4>Group Project Method</h4>
      Projects will be the collaborative efforts of the group to make great additions to the Powder Toy realm.<br>
      <h5>How to do a project</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Upload the initial save</li>
        <li>The next person to work on it does so and uploads it</li>
        <li>Cycle continues</li>
        <li>The project gets finished</li>
        <li>It gets uploaded under the <b>initial</b> creators account. Credit is given to <b>all</b> helpers. Include <b>all</b> ranks.</li>
      </ul>
      The initial creator has full direction, unless overridden by the AC.

      <h4>Advertisement</h4>
      If you wish to advertise this group, make sure you are smart about it. If you made a thread and you wish to advertise BMN inside it, go ahead. I'm just warning you though, it almost always kills the topic.<br>
      You may message people over the PM system, but please make sure you let them know that your message isn't spam, just an invite. <b>Do not</b> get into fights with people about this. If they say no, you say okay and move on.<br>
      Even of they give you a highly invalid reason, do not fight with them over it. They are entitled to their own opinions.<br>
      Happy advertising.
