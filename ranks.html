      <h4>Officer Ranks</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="label badge-warning">Fleet Admiral</span> Highest power of BMN. Head of the Admirals Counsel. There is only one of these at a time.</li>
        <li><span class="label badge-warning">Admiral</span> Second highest power. High leadership position in the AC. There are only two of these, and they can veto any decision made by the Fleet Admiral.</li>
        <li><span class="label badge-warning">Vice Admiral</span> AC leadership position. There are only two of these, and them, along with the rest of the lower Admirals, can veto any decision by the Fleet Admiral and/or the Admirals.</li>
        <li><span class="label badge-warning">Rear Admiral (Upper Half)</span> Leadership position, member of the AC. There are only up to two of these at a time. Can veto with Vice Admiral and Rear Admiral LH.</li>
        <li><span class="label badge-warning">Rear Admiral (Lower Half)</span> Leadership position, low member of the AC. There are only two of them at a time, and they usually do the "paperwork" (or at least what counts as paperwork in TPT) of the AC. Can veto with Vice Admiral and Rear Admiral UH.</li>
        <li><span class="label badge-silver">Captain</span> There are only two of these, and they are the leaders of the Medium Officers Counsel. One Captain will be a sit-in member of the AC and can put his/her own views in.</li>
        <li><span class="label badge-bronze">Commander</span> There are only three of these, and they are the Second-in-Commands of the MOC. One of them will also be a member of the AC and can put his/her own views in.</li>
        <li><span class="label badge-bronze">Lieutenant Commander</span> There are only three of these, and they are in the last Officer position to also have a place in the AC. He/she can only put in views if approved by both the AC Captain and the AC Commander. This is also the last member position of the MOC.</li>
        <li><span class="label badge-inverted">Lieutenant</span> There are three of these, and one of them is the leader of the Lower Officers Counsel. This leader is also a sit-in member of the MOC and can put his/her views into play.</li>
        <li><span class="label badge-inverted">Lieutenant, Junior Grade</span> There are four of these, and they are the Second-in-Command position of the LOC. They are also the second-to-last Officer rank.</li>
        <li><span class="label badge-inverted">Ensign</span> There are five of these, and they are the lowest Officer ranks, as well as the lowest member of the LOC.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Preofficer Ranks</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="label badge-success">Officer Candidate</span> Essentially the waiting list to replace Officers which are being removed.</li>
        <li><span class="label badge-default">Upper Recruit</span> One below Officer Candidate. They begin training for Officer ranks here.</li>
        <li><span class="label badge-default">Lower Recruit</span> Everyone starts here. As long as you post 5 times, you will be promoted. If you don't get promoted from here within a week, you will be removed.</li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <h4>Admirals Counsel</h4>
      The Admirals Counsel is comprised of the Admiral positions. The AC is where all rule creations, changes and fixes will be made, as well as promotions, demotions and member removals (discharges).<br>
      <ul>
        <li>For a member to be removed, three out of the five top Admirals have to vote yes.</li>
        <li>For a demotion, any four Admirals must vote for yes, unless vetoed by an Admiral or the current Fleet Admiral.</li>
        <li>Promotions need four Admirals to vote for yes, of course the new rank must be open and not taken yet.</li>
        <li>A non-Admiral requires six Admirals to vote yes so he/she can join the AC.</li>
        <li>For a rule creation or change, more than half of the Admirals need to vote yes. For a rule fix, it only needs three unless vetoed by the top five Admirals.</li>
      </ul>
      Any thread that is tagged with "(AC)" means that it is an Admirals Counsel discussion only. You may watch it, but only Captains and Commander AC sit-ins max post there.<br>
      There may be a few exceptions where we allow Captains, Commanders and maybe even Lieutenant Commanders into the AC.

      <h4>Inactive Movement Cycle (IMC/IRC)</h4>
      Around every month there will be an event called the Inactive Movement Cycle. I will be moving around people who are inactive frequently and promoting very frequent, deserving users.<br>
      <b>Note:</b> If you go on vavation and you have no idea if an IMC is coming soon, tell me about it and tell me when you get back. If you warn me in advance, you will be safe from the movement.
